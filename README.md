# Classly Studio Management

Classly is a full-stack platform for managing classes, enrollments, and payments for studios. The system combines a Supabase-secured REST API with a React 19 dashboard that adapts to Admin, Instructor, and Student roles.

## Project Overview
- **Purpose:** Manage studios end-to-end—courses, schedules, enrollments, attendance, payments, and role-based analytics.
- **Backend:** Express + TypeScript API backed by Supabase (PostgreSQL) with Stripe payment processing and role-aware middleware.
- **Frontend:** React 19 + Vite single-page dashboard with role-driven navigation and feature gating.
- **Database:** PostgreSQL schema (Supabase) with RLS policies, triggers, and indexes defined in `studio_management_schema_setup.sql`.

## Tech Stack
- **API:** Node.js, Express, TypeScript, Pino, Helmet, Rate limiting, CORS, Supabase Admin SDK, Stripe SDK.
- **Web:** React 19, TypeScript, Vite, Recharts, Lucide Icons, Supabase client, Axios, Stripe Elements.
- **Database:** PostgreSQL (Supabase) with RLS, triggers for auth user provisioning, and domain tables for studios, classes, enrollments, attendance, and payments.

## API Documentation
All routes are prefixed with `/api` and secured by `authenticateUser` unless noted. Role enforcement uses `requireRole`.

## Client-Side UX
Role determines available tabs and content rendered via `Sidebar` and `App.tsx` state machine.

### Admin
- **Dashboard:** Metrics, revenue & attendance charts fed by `/api/dashboard/admin`.
- **Students:** Advanced roster with search, pagination, CSV export, class filter, and sorting. Integrates API-backed fetching and course list loading for filters.
- **Schedule:** Weekly class timetable with capacity indicators (see `components/admin/ClassSchedule.tsx`).
- **Payments:** Payment history view (admin-only tab).
- **Settings:** Placeholder tab for future admin settings.

### Instructor
- **Dashboard:** Instructor KPIs via `/api/dashboard/instructor` (uses `InstructorDashboard`).
- **Students:** List of students registered to instructor’s classes (`/api/students/my-students`).
- **Schedule:** Instructor’s schedule view (`InstructorSchedule`).
- **Attendance:** Mark attendance through `/api/attendance` (accessed from schedule/related UI elements).

### Student
- **Dashboard:** Personalized overview of enrollments and attendance (`StudentDashboard`).
- **Browse Courses:** Discover enrollable courses (`/api/courses/available`) and initiate self-registration/payment via `/api/enrollments/register` and Stripe Elements.

Navigation: `Sidebar` filters available tabs per role (Admin: dashboard, students, schedule, payments, settings; Instructor: dashboard, students, schedule; Student: dashboard, browse courses). Logout calls Supabase sign-out.

## Database Schema
Key tables from `studio_management_schema_setup.sql`:

| Table | Purpose | Key Columns & Relationships |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `users` | Profiles synced with Supabase Auth users; includes roles and studio membership. | `id` (PK, FK auth.users), `role`, `studio_id` (FK studios), `status`, audit fields. |
| `studios` | Studio entities owned by admin users. | `admin_id` (FK users), contact/billing info, `is_active`. |
| `categories` | Class categories per studio. | `studio_id` FK studios, `type`, `is_active`, display fields. |
| `classes` | Class definitions/schedules. | `studio_id` FK studios, `category_id` FK categories, `instructor_id` FK users, timing, capacity, pricing, `is_active`. |
| `enrollments` | Student enrollment records with payment status and date range. | `studio_id` FK studios, `student_id` FK users, `class_id` FK classes, `parent_id` FK users, `status`, `payment_status`, `start_date`/`end_date`. |
| `attendance` | Attendance logs per session and enrollment. | `studio_id` FK studios, `class_id` FK classes, `instructor_id` FK users, `enrollment_id` FK enrollments, `student_id` FK users, `session_date`, `status`. |
| `payments` | Payment records with linkage to enrollments and instructors. | `studio_id` FK studios, `enrollment_id` FK enrollments, `student_id`/`instructor_id` FK users, `amount_ils`, `payment_method`, `status`, invoice fields. |
| `instructor_commissions` | Commission settings and payouts. | `studio_id` FK studios, `instructor_id`/`class_id` FK users/classes, `commission_percentage`, `billing_cycle`, `payment_status`. |
| `schedule_sessions` | Individual session occurrences for classes. | `studio_id` FK studios, `class_id` FK classes, `session_date`, time span, `status`, capacity counts. |
| `notifications` | User notifications. | `user_id`/`studio_id` FKs users/studios, `type`, `title`, `message`, `is_read`. |
| `audit_logs` | Audit trail of user actions. | `user_id`/`studio_id` FKs users/studios, `action`, `table_name`, `record_id`, `changes`. |

Additional logic: trigger `handle_new_user` seeds `users` on auth signup; `increment_enrollment` helper updates class counts; RLS policies enforce studio-scoped access and role checks.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 20+ and npm
- Supabase project (URL + service role key)
- Stripe secret key for payments

### Installation
```bash
# Clone
git clone <repository-url>
cd Classly-Studio_Management

# Install client
cd client
npm install

# Install server
cd ../server
npm install
```

### Environment Variables
Create `.env` files:

`client/.env`
```
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_project_url
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
```

`server/.env`
```
PORT=5000
CLIENT_URL=http://localhost:5173
SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_project_url
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your_supabase_service_role_key
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=your_stripe_secret_key
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=your_webhook_secret
```

### Running Locally
```bash
# API
cd server
npm run dev

# Web
cd ../client
npm run dev
```
Visit the client on the Vite dev URL (default `http://localhost:5173`) and ensure the server port matches `CLIENT_URL` CORS configuration.

### Notes & Ambiguities
- Payments route currently allows `INSTRUCTOR` in `/api/payments`; comments suggest restricting to admins—validate with product requirements.
- Self-registration flow assumes paid courses; zero-price handling is noted but not fully implemented.
- Attendance and enrollment ownership checks rely on Supabase data consistency; ensure instructor-class relationships exist.
